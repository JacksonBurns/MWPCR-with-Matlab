# MWPCR-with-Matlab

We want to Implementation MWPCR(Multiscale Weighted Principal Component Regression) with Matlab.Then,We finish a simple binary classification example (example),and the data sets and datasets.mat.

Refer to the paper "MWPCR: Multiscale Weighted Principal Component Regression for High-dimensional Prediction" for more details about the methods and models.
